## Design

The following **required** functionality is complete:

an (honest) assessment of how well your idea panned out and how likely your project is to change power or equity.

The following **items** are delivered:
- [X] Paper
- [X] Code (http://cs4784project.info/)

Room for improvment: 
1. More oomph
2. Better information


## Notes
Challenges I encountered include setting up a website and finding articles on the topic. Overcoming a curious case of writers block was also a part of my experiance.
