## Design

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **items** are delivered:
- [ ] Slide deck

1. More oomph
2. Better information


## Notes
Challenges I encountered include not realizing that many API’s for IP geolocation cost money. Nevertheless a solid informational website on the topic was a great solution.
